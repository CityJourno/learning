# Contributing

We welcome link submissions via pull requests, as long as they meet the following principles:

- An article, video, or podcast that teaches a new technology, language or tool
- The guide must have an aspect of learning, ideally with code examples or demos
- It must follow the template set out in the `template.md` file
- You, as the submitter, must include a brief note explaining the guide, and why it's good


### Review

Initially a member of The Times Digital Development team will review all submissions to ensure they match the above principles, and are of a high quality. Over time, we'd like this resource to become owned and managed by the community, for all developers to learn new skills.
